Further Reading
===============

This tutorial is only the beginning. The concepts of specification,
verification, and proof maintenance are applicable to a variety of
tools, not just SAW, and SAW itself contains many more features than
those exhibited here.

Specification with Cryptol
--------------------------

The best source for learning more about Cryptol is the free book
`Programming Cryptol`_. Galois maintains this book as Cryptol evolves.

.. _Programming Cryptol: https://www.cryptol.net/files/ProgrammingCryptol.pdf

This book is suitable both as a tutorial and as a reference.

Verification with SAW
---------------------

The `SAW tutorial`_ describes small problems, similar in scope to
:ref:`swap-example`, but uses a somewhat different set of SAW
features. It is a good next step after this document. After that, the
`SAW manual`_ provides detailed descriptions.
